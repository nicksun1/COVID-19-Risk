# COVID-19-Risk

At a time when COVID_19 was just starting to take over the world we realized the spread of this virus could have implications on our ability to enroll new patients and/or keep in touch with current ones. 

Many Phase-3 studies were starting patient enrollment, in the middle of patient enrollment, or in the middle of their study timeline. Given the status of the spread of COVID-19 in the US and other countries at the time, it was expected that the number of evaluable endpoints would be impacted. COVID-19 presented an unknown and unaccounted for factor in execution of many different clinical studies. Current and future factors of coronavirus included impact on enrollment, treatment discontinuation, study medication disruption, and primary endpoint analysis. 

Risk level was based on number of cases in each country for global studies and ratio of available hospital beds by county for US based studies. Each risk level was given a shrinkage factor which was then applied to a given study's population size/primary endpoint population to assess if action needed to be taken from risk of losing statistical significance.
