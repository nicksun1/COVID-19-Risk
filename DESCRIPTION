Description: At the time of project conception in late March, early April of 2020, COVID-19 was entering one of its fastest spreading time periods in the US and globally.
      There was concern this virus and subsequent lockdown effect would affect the viability of ongoing and new studies for 2020. This project assess risk to study
      viability using a self-created in-house risk assessment equation. For US studies data is downloaded from http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads and risk
      is based on availability of hospital beds. For outside US studies, as more precise data is limited, data is scraped from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
      and based on ratio of infections and deaths.
